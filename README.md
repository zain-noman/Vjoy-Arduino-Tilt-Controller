# Vjoy-Arduino-Tilt-Controller
This is a very basic repo through which can use Arduino with a mpu6050 to make a tilt sensing controller


to build this yourself
- go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/
- compile the program.cs file
- download the feeder SDK
- place the correct dll from the archive near the compiled exe file
- upload the code to your Arduio. (You can work out the wiring from the sketch)
- run the compiled exe and everything should work!
